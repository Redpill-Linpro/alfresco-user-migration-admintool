Alfresco User Migration Tool
=============================================

This module is sponsored by Redpill Linpro AB - http://www.redpill-linpro.com.

Description
-----------
This Share Admin console tool is used when there is a need to change the username of one or more Alfresco users. It transfers node ownerships, site and group memberships from one user to another. The original user stays but could be marked as disabled by preference.

Building & Installation
------------
The build produces two amp-files, one for the repository and one for share. Use the module management tool to install those onto the war files.

Usage
------------
Log in as admin and a new admin console tool "Replace User" will materialize with instructions.
